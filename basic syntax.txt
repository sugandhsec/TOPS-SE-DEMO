Basic Syntax:  The basic structure of a C program includes a preprocessor directive, global variables declaration, function declaration, and the main function.

        Preprocessor directive: This is the first line of a C program, which starts with the # symbol and includes preprocessor commands.

        Global variables declaration: In C, we declare variables that are accessible to all the functions in the program. 

        Function declaration: In C, we define functions to perform specific operations on variables.

        Main function: This is the main body of the program, which contains the instructions to execute the program.

Real world Example : 

	Preprocessor directive:  This step is similar to preparing ingredients for a meal. Before we start cooking, we need to gather all the necessary ingredients and prepare them for cooking.

    Global variables declaration: In the context of preparing a meal, global variables could be the ingredients that we need for cooking the entire meal.

    Function declaration:  In the context of preparing a meal, functions could be the individual recipes for each dish that we need to cook.

    Main function:  In the context of preparing a meal, the main function would be the recipe that contains instructions for preparing the entire meal.
		
		
syntax :
  

        #include<stdio.h> //preprocessor directive
        int a=5; //global variables
        void greeting() //function declaration
        {
            printf("hello");
        }
        int main() //main function
        {
            return 0;
        }
