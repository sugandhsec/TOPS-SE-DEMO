data structure:   C programming language, there are several data types that can be used to represent different kinds of values. 
       

Real world Example : 

	
Integer data type: This data type is used to represent whole numbers. For example, the number of students in a class or the number of desks in a classroom.

Floating-point data type: This data type is used to represent decimal numbers. For example, the average grade of a student or the time it takes for a student to complete a test.

Character data type: This data type is used to represent individual characters such as letters or symbols. For example, the first letter of a student's name or the symbol used to represent a grade (e.g., A, B, C, D, F).

String data type: This data type is used to represent a sequence of characters. For example, the name of a student or the name of a class.

		
syntax :
  
int: Used to store integer values, which are whole numbers without any decimal points. For example, int age = 25;

float: Used to store floating-point values, which are numbers with decimal points. For example, float price = 3.99;

double: Similar to float, but with greater precision. Used to store floating-point values with more decimal places. For example, double salary = 50000.50;

char: Used to store a single character value. For example, char grade = 'A';

long: Used to store larger integer values than int. For example, long population = 1000000;

short: Used to store smaller integer values than int. For example, short temperature = -10;

unsigned: Used to store only positive integer values. For example, unsigned int count = 10;
